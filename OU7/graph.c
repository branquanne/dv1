 * Description: This file the implementation of the graph module. The graph module
 *              provides a graph data structure and functions for creating and
 *              manipulating graphs. The graph module is used by the files graph.c
 *              and graph-test.c. The declaration of the functions can be found in
 *              the file graph.h.
